### Components design (in progress)

* This library is using es6 + jsx
* All assets are in `src/assets` folder
* Each component must have e2e & unit test as well as testkit provided. (It is recommened to make your testkits API the same across all testkit types)
* One React component per file
* Most of the components needs be a [controlled components](https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/), if you still think that a component should be uncontrolled after you read the article you are welcome to push a pr for it.
* Components needs to support rtl and ltr props
